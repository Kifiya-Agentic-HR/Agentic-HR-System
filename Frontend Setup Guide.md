# Frontend Setup Guide

This document outlines common resources and styles to use for the frontend of our project.

## Typography

We use the **Inter** font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look.

- **Source**: [Google Fonts - Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- **Implementation**: Add the following to your HTML `<head>` to include Inter:
  ```bash
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap">
  ```z
## Color Branding
Our brand identity is reflected in the following colors:

### Secondary Color: #FF8A00  
A vibrant orange for accents and calls-to-action.
