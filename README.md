## Overview
The Agentic HR System leverages cutting-edge Multi AI Agent to automate and optimize recruitment.

## How It Works
The system operates in five key stages, each represented in the frontend:

0. **Job Posting and Careers Page**
   HR posts job through the Dashboard and candidate can access the jobs through careers page
   
2. **Application Intake & Processing**  
   Candidates submit their applications (e.g., CVs), which are queued and processed in the order received.

3. **AI-Powered Candidate Screening**  
   The system analyzes CVs against job requirements, generating a match score with reasoning for HR review.

4. **Virtual Interview (AI Chatbot)**  
   Shortlisted candidates engage with an AI chatbot for an interview, which evaluates responses and provides a score.

5. **Automated Notifications & Personalized Emails**  
   Candidates receive timely updates:  
   - Confirmation of application receipt.  
   - Interview invite (if selected).  
   - Final decision from HR.
